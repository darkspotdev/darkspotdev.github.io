(we don’t really need those when using mathjax anyway) text formatting you can do a little text formatting in a latex math content (though it’s pointless to do so).\nliteral text you can make a text with \\text{}.\n\\text{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.} \\[\\text{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.}\\] boldface text you can make a text boldface with \\textbf{}.\n\\textbf{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.} \\[\\textbf{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.}\\] italic text to make a text block italic, enclose it with a \\textit{} command.\n\\textit{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.} \\[\\textit{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.}\\] monospaced text in order for the text to be monospaced, enclose it with a \\texttt{} (text teletype) command.\n\\texttt{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.} \\[\\texttt{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.}\\] text in sans-serif font equivalent most importantly, you can make a text rendered in sans-serif with \\textsf{} command.\n\\textsf{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.} \\[\\textsf{the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.}\\] more options you can see a lot more options from this reference.\nmath formatting this is what you mostly came for, right?\nall righty then. let’s see what mathjax in asciidoctor (m in a?) can do.\nfractions for rendering fractions, you need to use the \\frac command. the command simply needs two positional arguments.\n\\frac{numerator}{denominator} for a bit of an example:\n\\frac{x_1 + y_2}{x_2 + y_1} \\[\\frac{x_1 + y_2}{x_2 + y_1}\\] roots in order to create roots, you need the \\sqrt command. it only needs the content to be put inside of it as the argument.\n\\sqrt{2a + b} \\[\\sqrt{2a + b}\\] yes, you can nest some stuff.\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2a + b}{a^2 - b^2}} \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{2a + b}{a^2 - b^2}}\\] you can specify an optional argument to change the magnitude.\n\\sqrt[\\frac{1}{2}]{2a + b} \\[\\sqrt[\\frac{1}{2}]{2a + b}\\] superscripts in order to make superscripts, place it next to a caret character (^). to render it in more than one character, enclose it in curly brackets ({}).\n2^2 * 2^{23} = 2^{25} \\[2^2 * 2^{23} = 2^{25}\\] you can also nest it within a superscript like so.\n2^{2^{10}} * 2^{23^2} = \\infty \\[ 2^{2^{10}} * 2^{23^2} = \\infty\\] ok, i’ve gone overboard with the scale so i just put infinity as the answer instead.\nsubscripts for making subscripts, place it next to the underscore (_). like the superscript command, if you include more than one character, enclose it in a pair of curly brackets ({}).\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_{14} = \\frac{a_1 * a_{14}}{2} \\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_{14} = \\frac{a_1 * a_{14}}{2}\\] like superscripts and most of the commands, you can nest subscripts to another subscript (and other commands).\na_{2_{1}} + a_{2_{2}} = b_{2_{1}} + b_{2_{2}} \\[ a_{2_{1}} + a_{2_{2}} = b_{2_{1}} + b_{2_{2}}\\] greek letters you can render greek letters with the appropriate command.\n\\alpha for lowercase greek letter alpha, \\beta for lowercase greek letter beta, \\gamma for lowercase greek letter gamma, \\gamma for uppercase greek letter gamma, you get the point.\n\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\gamma, \\pi, \\pi, \\phi, \\varphi, \\mu, \\phi \\[\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\gamma, \\pi, \\pi, \\phi, \\varphi, \\mu, \\phi\\] mathematical sizing oftentimes, you might need to align and resize certain characters like the parenthesis or the brackets that enclose a formula or an example.\nyou can use the \\left, \\right, and \\middle commands to resize the delimiters.\n\\left(\\frac{x^2}{y^3}\\right) \\[\\left(\\frac{x^2}{y^3}\\right)\\] since curly braces have semantic meaning to \\(\\latex\\), you need to escape it. pretty much, it’ll look like this:\n\\left\\{\\frac{x^2}{y^3}\\right\\} \\[\\left\\{\\frac{x^2}{y^3}\\right\\}\\] a lot more! you have a whole slew of mathematical symbols available. please refer to this list of latex mathematical symbols. though i don’t know what’s missing symbols and whatnot (since i don’t mathjax often) but it should be enough.\nyou can also go to this web page that details using mathjax on quora by gilles castel. it is specifically made for writing \\(\\latex\\) on quora but it can be used as a general mathjax guide, anyways.\n","title":"Hello Word"},{"date":"2022-11-19","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://darkspotdev.github.io/posts/my-first-post/","summary":" Hello World ","tags":[],"text":" hello world ","title":"My First Post"}]
